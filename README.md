# Mini Lab

## Introduction

This mini-lab aims at test two implementations of substring search, Boyer Moore, Rabin-Karp and Brute Force.

## Setup

* Clone this project
* Open this project using your preferred IDE

## Instruction

* Generate a random sequence of DNA with 10.000 characters using [this address](http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/random_dna.html)
* Select part of the existing sequence to be your pattern
* Run the algorithms Boyer Moore, Rabin-Karp and Brute Force, counting the number of comparisons
* Check if the comparisons are in consonance with the estimated time complexity
